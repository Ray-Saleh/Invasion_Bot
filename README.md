+Warnings with the program:+

 1. Do not delete any folders other than folders named "Farm'x'" (x standing for a number), best to delete them when said in steps for help when creating
 your own version of this program.
 2. this program is very sensitive on wording so when things are put in '' or "" make sure its spelled to its exact or the program will not recognize said files
 which will result in a crash or will run the program and unrecognize that farm or base
 3. this program was created for testing and learning image recognition myself on a monitor any actions from Tap4Fun and all companies related will be on the person using
 this program on their computer and bases and I am not responsible for but not limited to: bans, fines, blacklist, legal issues, and so forth

++Step for the program to run++
 -1. go into Methods.py and go to line 69 and change it to your path of Nox.exe
        For example if you find you Nox.exe file in "D, Program files, Nox, Bin, Nox.exe" then you would enter or just copy the search bar

        os.startfile(r"D:\Program Files\Nox\bin\Nox.exe")

 -2. Then go to main.py and go to line 12 and change the numbers [1-25] to the amount of farms you had.
 -3.

        For example if you have 5 bases
        lst = [1,2,3,4,5]
        
 -3. then launch nox yourself and download invasion + log into each one of your accounts (ONLY WORKS WITH Tap4Fun Accounts so far)
 
 -4. next create x amounts of files called 'Farm"x"' into the main folder

 -5. Then take screenshots of farm names from the menu and put said screenshots in 'Farm"x"' folders with the image-name 'name'
 
   ![name](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95549738/213341782-5ff4fe1c-dd85-4142-a031-5c4321630925.png)
 
 -6. once done run program and watch as it logs into each account if it does not log into the account then retake the snipit and retry running the program
 
 Examples of my snips of bases are in the file, Make sure you delete my files and images within the Farm folders to add your own and have the program run
 if there are any issues try again and or leave comments here. I will check after a while and try to help you if stuck but other than that i've quit the game.
 I stopped playing when T6 were released so no guarentees this program still works I created it to learn and help my zone.

Hope this is helpful wish you all the best!!
